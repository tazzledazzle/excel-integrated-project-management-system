## Installation & Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tazzledazzle/excel-integrated-project-management-system.git
    cd excel-integrated-project-management-system
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Start the Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

4. **Access the App**
    Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port indicated in your terminal).

5. **Try Excel Integration**
    - Download the Excel template from the "Excel Integration" section in the app.
    - Enable the Office Add-In inside Excel.
    - Generate a token for your project in the web app and paste it into the Excel Add-In.
    - Fill timesheet data and submit directly from Excel.

## Troubleshooting

- **Install/Run Problems**
    - Ensure Node.js (v18+) and npm/yarn are installed and up-to-date.
    - If the development server does not start, try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again.
- **Excel Add-In Not Working**
    - Confirm your version of Excel supports Office JS Add-Ins.
    - Make sure the project token is copied correctly from the web app.
